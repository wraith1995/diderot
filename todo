TODO:
Minor misc:
1. Vectorization in basis eval
2. WorldPos in simple for both sides - why not disabled?
3. Femname review
4. Affine inverse find and affine optimizations.
5. Pos cache update and other cache strats (per instruction x+h tracing, etc?)
6. Equality for big fem
7. Force inverse optimization or disable inverse optimization?
8. Make border control error.
9. Ref tuple?
10. Basis field

Minor geom:
-Bounding box for ray intersect
-bounding box for facets
-more geometry access: distance function,facets, edges,
-FFI for this and maybe default - class metohds
-access to simplexiation of the cell


Minor inside:
Need to do comp, fem, might need reognize inserts

Irrelevant bug fix:
1. Hoare logic multi
2. Dof cache mult
3. Does chained select still work?
4. Do tuple snapshots work
5. Sphere bug
6. Does equal check really work?

Major:
Interval
Affine
bspline
