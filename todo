TODO:
Minor misc:
1. Vectorization in basis eval
2. WorldPos in simple for both sides - why not disabled?
3. Femname review
4. Affine inverse find and affine optimizations.
5. Pos cache update and other cache strats (per instruction x+h tracing, etc?, loads if already loadedxo)
6. Equality for big fem
7. Force inverse optimization or disable inverse optimization?
8. Make border control error.
9. Ref tuple?
10. Basis field
11. Scalarization

Minor geom:
-Bounding box for ray intersect
-bounding box for facets
-more geometry access: distance function,facets, edges,
-FFI for this and maybe default - class metohds
-access to simplexiation of the cell


Minor inside:
Need to do comp, fem, might need reognize inserts
Plan:
--AST: add inside and fix associated things (pp, etc)
--Keep the inside basis vars to be 1
--places where I make prim thing - I am going to check for inside--do the specifics and generate that
---make a func for this
--propogate this and replace in simple
--make key replace in fields
--run tests (okay...)
--Do the damb thing:
---rewrite image type
---rewrite ops on it
---do the analysis
---write generator


Irrelevant bug fix:
1. Hoare logic multi
2. Dof cache mult
3. Does chained select still work?
4. Do tuple snapshots work
5. Sphere bug
6. Does equal check really work?

Major:
Interval
Affine
bspline
lifter for certain optimizations
